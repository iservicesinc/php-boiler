# Security Policy

We strive to ensure that our code is clean, secure and free of any defect. 
However, due to the nature of development and the use of third party components/packages, 
there are possibilities of security related concerns arising.

This project has very few dependencies to start with, we recommend always keeping them updated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any security concerns or vulnerabilities privately to devops@iservicesinc.com.
